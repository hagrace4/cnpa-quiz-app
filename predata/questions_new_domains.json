Controllers continuously watch the desired state (defined in manifests) and compare it to the actual state of the cluster. When drift is detected, the controller takes action to reconcile the actual state back to the desired state. This declarative model is fundamental to Kubernetes' self-healing capabilities and is the basis for operators and custom controllers.",
